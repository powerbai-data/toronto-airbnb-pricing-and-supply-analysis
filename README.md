🔗 Tableau Public Dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/power.bai1487/viz/toronto-airbnb-pricing-and-supply-analysis/toronto-airbnb-pricing-and-supply-analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb listing prices, supply distribution, and demand patterns
across Toronto using Tableau. The goal is to understand spatial price variation, the
impact of room types on pricing, and whether higher prices correspond to higher demand.

## Business Questions
- How does Airbnb pricing vary across Toronto neighbourhoods?
- Where are listings most concentrated, and how do typical prices vary spatially?
- How do room types influence nightly prices?
- Is there a relationship between price and recent demand?

## Data & Methodology
- Data source: Airbnb Open Data (Toronto)
- Price refers to nightly listing price.
- Prices above $1000 were excluded in distribution analysis to improve interpretability.
- Map color scale capped at $300 to highlight typical market prices.
- Reviews in the last 12 months were used as a proxy for recent demand.
- Analysis and visualization were performed using Tableau Public.

## Key Insights
- Airbnb prices vary significantly across neighbourhoods, with central areas generally
  exhibiting higher average nightly prices.
- Entire home/apt listings command substantially higher prices than private or shared rooms.
- Price distributions are strongly right-skewed, indicating a small number of luxury listings.
- Higher nightly prices do not necessarily correspond to higher recent demand.

## Tools Used
- Tableau Public
